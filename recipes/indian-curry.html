      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.<p></p></li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in
        the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer 
        browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.<p></p></li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil 
        remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and 
        translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander,
        cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat 
        together for about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 
        tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to 
        combine.<p></p></li>
      <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. 
        Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with
        the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.<p></p></li>
      <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in 
        the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read 
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F 
        (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.<p></p></li>
